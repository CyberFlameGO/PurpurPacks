# Purpur Packs
Requested Purpur features that would be better as a datapack

These are the features that have been requested on [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur/discussions) that have been decided would be better as a datapack!
These datapacks work in vanilla, you do not need to be using Purpur to use them (tho it'd be cool if you did)
