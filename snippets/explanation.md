### PurpurPacks
PurpurPacks are features that have been suggested to be added to the [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) server software - or would fit Purpur's theme, but were decided would fit better as a datapack!

Each datapack functions the same as a singular configuration setting would in Purpur. They can be added and removed at any time without damaging the server.

These datapacks do not depend on Purpur; they work completely fine in vanilla or any other server software.
